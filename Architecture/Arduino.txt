Arduino : (https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/understanding-arduino-uno-hardware-design/)

- Is a open source electronic protoyping platform,The microcontroller on the board is programmed using Arduino programming language and ADE is based on processing , it can be standalone 

- Microcontroller are IC tiny computer with low power and high speed 

- Owner is at Italy
-We can use shields for mp3 etc

- not go surface mount ship (atmega328 fixed cant take out if its fired we need to though out)
  so go with dual in line package
  
- RISC (reduced instruction set computer) is a microprocessor that is designed to perform a
smaller number of types of computer instructions so that it can operate at a higher speed (perform more millions of instructions per second, or MIPS).

- In circuit serial programming is used to boot loader atmega328 

- Usb to serial UART interface microcontroller  communication used send back and forth The bridge in the latest revision is the ATmega16U2 
 Computer works at 2.3GHZ and arduino at 16MHZ for sinking and commuinate with each other 

- Atmega328 has internal clock of 8Mhz

- Near controller we have crystal resonater for speeding 

-  Arduino's PWM frequency at about 500Hz  analogWrite() is on a scale of 0 - 255, such that analogWrite(255) requests a 100% duty cycle (always on), and analogWrite(127) is a 50% duty cycle (on half the time) for example.

- Led is for begugging 

- Digital pin uses tri state buffer ( HIGH,LOW,read values)

- 9600 bit per second 

- Arduino use 10bit number for analog to digial convertion in analog read 
and analog write is 8bit so uses the map function map(analogRead(),0,1023,0,255)

- On board near 3.3v we have 3v regulator and above 5v regulator we have transistor on top of Tx we have resistor array 
  dot on board in VIA
